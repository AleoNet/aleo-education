/// We are going to implement a game of Hangman in Leo.

/// Hangman is a game where a player attempts to guess all characters contained in a word.
/// A player wins if they are able to guess all characters within the allotted number of guesses. Otherwise, they lose.
/// 1. In our version of Hangman, words and guesses are restricted to the lowercase English alphabet.
/// 2. An invalid guess does not use up a guess.
/// Note: Once done with the presentation, ask people to see if they can optimize the number of constraints in the circuit. Maybe they can organize the code in a better way? Maybe better use of constrol structures?
/// Note: What other functionality can you add? Maybe a lower bound on the number of guesses based on the number of unique characters?
